# assembly-and-python
Hi, Iâ€™m FAITH-GLITH! ðŸ‘‹  
Iâ€™m a beginner programmer with a strong interest in exploring the world of **Assembly**, **Python**, **Cybersecurity**, and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**. I'm excited to learn how these technologies work and how they can be applied to real-world problems.

Currently, Iâ€™m focusing on:
- **Learning Assembly** for low-level programming and understanding how computers really work.
- **Mastering Python** for building useful scripts, automation, and diving into data science and AI.
- Exploring **Cybersecurity** to better understand how to protect data and systems.
- Getting hands-on with **AI and Machine Learning** to solve complex problems and build intelligent systems.

Iâ€™m still in the early stages, but Iâ€™m eager to learn and grow through building projects and collaborating with others. Feel free to check out my repositories, and letâ€™s connect if you have advice, tips, or want to work on something together!

Letâ€™s learn and create something awesome! ðŸš€
